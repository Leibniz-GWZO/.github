## Leibniz Institute for the History and Culture of Eastern Europe (GWZO)
The GWZO focuses its research on the region between the Baltic, Black and Adriatic Sea. From Late Antiquity until the present, we examine peculiarities, transformations and interrelationships in an ever-more global world. Fundamental deep knowledge about Eastern Europe is created when experts from different disciplines of the humanities and academic cultures come together. We inform experts and the public about our research results with non-fiction and guidebooks, exhibitions, events and digital knowledge resources. In this way, we bring light to past and current developments in Eastern Europe.
